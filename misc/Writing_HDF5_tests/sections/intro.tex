\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}

Writing HDF5 tests can be a time-consuming process that is made worse when newly-written tests pass
on a development machine but fail or exhibit problematic behavior in other places and on other platforms
where HDF5 is tested. This document outlines some of the more common problems test authors may encounter
and is intended to be a general guide for writing HDF5 tests.
