\subsection{Error checking and handling in serial tests}

Serial HDF5 tests can make use of the \texttt{TESTING()}, \texttt{H5\_FAILED()}, \texttt{TEST\_ERROR()},
etc. macros for error handling if they include the \texttt{h5test.h} header from the 'h5test' framework.
For compatibility reasons, the 'testframe' framework has a similarly-named set of macros
(e.g., \texttt{TESTFRAME\_TEST\_ERROR()}) in the \texttt{testframe.h} header to help when porting an
'h5test' test program over to the 'testframe' framework. Note that 'testframe' tests rely on the testing
framework for certain portions of output, so specific macros like \texttt{H5\_FAILED()} do not have a
counterpart in the 'testframe' framework. Generally speaking, tests that integrate with the 'testframe'
framework should only use the set of macros in \texttt{testframe.h}, if need be, while other tests should
use the set of macros in \texttt{h5test.h}, if need be. Mixing and matching the two should be avoided.
Further, any tests that are part of the \texttt{testhdf5} test program should avoid both sets of macros
and instead only use the macros from the \texttt{testhdf5.h} header to prevent problems that can occur
when mixing and matching the sets of macros.
