\subsection{Error checking and handling in serial tests}

Serial HDF5 tests can make use of the \texttt{TESTING()}, \texttt{H5\_FAILED()}, \texttt{TEST\_ERROR()},
etc. macros for error handling if they include the \texttt{h5test.h} header. Tests that are part of the \texttt{testhdf5} test program should avoid this and instead only use the macros from the
\texttt{testhdf5.h} header to prevent problems that can occur when mixing and matching the sets of macros.
