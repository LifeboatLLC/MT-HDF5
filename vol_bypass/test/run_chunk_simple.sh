# The number of data sections isn't used in posix_read_mthread.c, and posix_read_tpool.c:
#     NTHREADS_FOR_MULTI: number of threads for the multi-thread application
#     NTHREADS_FOR_TPOOL: number of threads for the thread pool
#     NSTEPS_QUEUE:       number of tasks to be put into thread pool queue in each step
#     MAX_NELMTS:         maximal number of data elements (not in bytes) for each data pieces to be read
#     NDATA_SECTIONS:     number of dataset sections to break down big datasets by rows in case they are bigger than the memory size.
#                         e.g. if the memory size is 32GB, datasets of 64GB won't fit in.  This option breaks down the datasets
#                         in sections for creation and reading. Remember to avoid break down small datasets in case unexpected errors.
