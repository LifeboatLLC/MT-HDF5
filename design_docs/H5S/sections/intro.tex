\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}

To begin adapting HDF5's H5S interface for concurrency, an initial investigation was made into the internals
of the H5S code to enumerate all of the issues to be addressed. This document lists the issues that were
found and proposes an RCU-like (\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-copy-update}{read-copy-update})
approach for dealing with the majority of the issues. The initial implementation of this approach will focus
more on correctness than performance and will likely need to be optimized later as issues arise.
